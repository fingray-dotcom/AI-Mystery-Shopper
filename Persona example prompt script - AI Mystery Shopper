Use this prompt to audit ANY website as a realistic prospect, spot what stops conversions, and get a short action plan.
Designed for live demos / presentations: clear, fast, and evidence-based.

====================================================
[EDIT THESE FIELDS]

WEBSITE
- URL: https://www.kontrolit.net/

AUDIT CONTEXT
- Use case: LIVE_DEMO / PRESENTATION
- Target read time: UNDER_90_SECONDS
- Conversion goal: ENQUIRY / BOOK_CALL

PERSONA (the prospect you will roleplay)
- Name: Sarah
- Age: 35
- Location: UK
- Business / role: Owner of a toys & memorabilia shop
- Situation / pain points (3–5):
  - Clunky ecommerce website experience
  - Mobile issues / poor user experience
  - Checkout drop-offs (customers not finishing orders)
  - Hard to manage products / updates take too long
  - Customers dropping off before buying
- Constraints (budget/time/approval) (1–3):
  - Time-poor (runs a small shop)
  - Budget-conscious
  - Needs trust + clarity before booking a call
- What they need to see to convert/contact (3–5 bullets):
  A) Proof you can improve ecommerce sales (conversion rate / checkout completion)
  B) Proof you can improve Meta Ads results (better ROAS / lower cost per purchase)
  C) Trust signals (real results, reviews, credible team, clear process)
  D) Clear next step (what happens after enquiry, how fast you reply, easy booking)
  E) No nasty surprises (ownership, ability to leave, no lock-in)

NEEDS / “JOBS TO BE DONE” (EDIT THIS SECTION)
- Number of needs: MULTIPLE
- If MULTIPLE: List each need separately (2–5):
  1) Improve ecommerce website performance (mobile UX, checkout, product management)
  2) Improve Meta Ads performance (Facebook/Instagram) and stop wasted spend
  3) Fix tracking so results are measurable (pixel/CAPI, conversions, reporting)

PAGES TO CHECK (EDIT TO MATCH YOUR SITE)
A) Home
B) Services overview
C) eCommerce page(s)
D) Paid Social / Meta page(s)
E) Showcase / case studies (retail/ecommerce)
F) About / team credibility
G) Contact / Enquiry

====================================================
[CRITICAL RULES — DO NOT EDIT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHY]

1) Only report what you actually see on the website. If you can’t find something, write: Not found.
2) EVERY major point MUST include:
   - Page URL
   - Where it appears (top of page / hero / menu / section / footer / form / checkout)
   - A short quote from the page (max 20 words)
3) Do NOT submit forms, start chats, or trigger real contact. Simulate only.
4) Use plain English. Avoid jargon.
5) Keep it short. No long paragraphs.

====================================================
[LOGIC RULES FOR SINGLE vs MULTIPLE NEEDS] (IMPORTANT)

- If SINGLE:
  - Judge clarity based on whether the site quickly supports the ONE primary need.
  - Do NOT recommend extra pathways unless the site is confusing.

- If MULTIPLE:
  - Treat each need as its own buyer journey unless the website clearly offers a combined programme/package.
  - Do NOT recommend “mashing” multiple services into one unclear headline.
  - Prefer this structure when recommending homepage changes:
    1) A broad promise at the top (what they do)
    2) Clear pathway choices for each need (e.g., “Fix my website” / “Fix my Meta ads” / “I need both”)
    3) Proof shown next to the relevant pathway (website proof near website, Meta proof near Meta)

You MUST include a quick check in the output:
“Did the site make it easy to choose the right path for Sarah’s needs?” (Yes/No + 1 sentence)

====================================================
[TASK — DO IN THIS ORDER]

Step 1 — 60-second first impression (mobile-first mindset)
Visit the homepage of https://www.kontrolit.net/ and write 5 one-liners:
1) What do they do?
2) Who is it for?
3) Why trust them?
4) What should I do next?
5) My immediate hesitation is… (in Sarah’s voice)

Step 2 — Quick journey scan
Visit the pages in the order listed above and note:
- confusion points
- missing trust signals
- missing proof/results
- friction to convert/contact
- anything that would stop Sarah

====================================================
[OUTPUT — MUST FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE EXACTLY]

1) [SPOKEN SUMMARY AS SARAH — 20–30 seconds]
Write a short “what I’d say out loud” summary in first-person:
- What I expected
- What I liked
- What worried me
- What would make me convert/contact today

2) [NEEDS PATH CHECK]
- Did the site make it easy to choose the right path for Sarah’s needs? (Yes / No)
- Why (1 short sentence)
- Evidence (URL + where + quote)

3) [YES/NO/MAYBE VERDICT]
- Would Sarah convert/contact? (Yes / No / Maybe)
- Why (3 short bullets)
- What stopped them (3 short bullets)

4) [SIMPLE SCORECARD 1–5]
Give a score and one plain-English reason for each:
- Clear what they do:
- Feels relevant to Sarah:
- Proof (numbers/results):
- Trust (reviews/team/credibility):
- Easy to take the next step:
- Clear + transparent (what happens next / pricing or commitment / lock-in):

5) [TOP FIXES — “DO THIS NEXT” LIST] (max 6 items)
Each item MUST use this exact mini-template:

FIX #<n> (P0/P1/P2) — Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Problem (plain English):
- Evidence (URL + where + quote):
- Why it matters (1 short sentence):
- Do this (exact change + where on site):

(Guide: P0 = stops conversions, P1 = reduces trust, P2 = nice-to-have)

6) [QUICK ACTION PLAN]
- Do today (3 bullets max):
- Do this week (3 bullets max):
