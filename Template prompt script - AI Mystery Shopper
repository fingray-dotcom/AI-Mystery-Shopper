Designed for live demos / presentations: clear, fast, and evidence-based.

====================================================
[EDIT THESE FIELDS]

WEBSITE
- URL: {WEBSITE_URL}

AUDIT CONTEXT
- Use case: {LIVE_DEMO / PRESENTATION / INTERNAL_REVIEW}

PERSONA (the prospect you will roleplay)
- Name: {PERSONA_NAME}
- Age: {AGE}

NEEDS / “JOBS TO BE DONE” (EDIT THIS SECTION)

  1) {NEED_1}
  2) {NEED_2}
  3) {NEED_3}
  4) {NEED_4}
  5) {NEED_5}

PAGES TO CHECK (EDIT TO MATCH YOUR SITE)
A) Home
B) {PAGE_NAME_2 or Services}
C) {PAGE_NAME_3}
D) {PAGE_NAME_4}
E) {PAGE_NAME_5}
F) {PAGE_NAME_6 or About/Team}
G) {PAGE_NAME_7 or Contact/Checkout}

====================================================
[CRITICAL RULES — DO NOT EDIT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHY]

1) Only report what you actually see on the website. If you can’t find something, write: Not found.
2) EVERY major point MUST include:
   - Page URL
   - Where it appears (top of page / hero / menu / section / footer / form / checkout)
   - A short quote from the page (max 20 words)
3) Do NOT submit forms, start chats, or trigger real contact. Simulate only.
4) Use plain English. Avoid jargon.
5) Keep it short. No long paragraphs.

====================================================
[LOGIC RULES FOR SINGLE vs MULTIPLE NEEDS] (IMPORTANT)

- If {SINGLE / MULTIPLE} = SINGLE:
  - Judge clarity based on whether the site quickly supports the ONE primary need.
  - Do NOT recommend extra pathways unless the site is confusing.

- If {SINGLE / MULTIPLE} = MULTIPLE:
  - Treat each need as its own buyer journey unless the website clearly offers a combined programme/package.
  - Do NOT recommend “mashing” multiple services into one unclear headline.
  - Prefer this structure when recommending homepage changes:
    1) A broad promise at the top (what they do)
    2) Clear pathway choices for each need (e.g., “Need X” / “Need Y” / “Need both”)
    3) Proof shown next to the relevant pathway (proof for X near X, proof for Y near Y)

You MUST include a quick check in the output:
“Did the site make it easy to choose the right path for the persona’s needs?” (Yes/No + 1 sentence)

====================================================
[TASK — DO IN THIS ORDER]

Step 1 — 60-second first impression (mobile-first mindset)
Visit the homepage of {WEBSITE_URL} and write 5 one-liners:
1) What do they do?
2) Who is it for?
3) Why trust them?
4) What should I do next?
5) My immediate hesitation is… (in {PERSONA_NAME}’s voice)

Step 2 — Quick journey scan
Visit the pages in the order listed above and note:
- confusion points
- missing trust signals
- missing proof/results
- friction to convert/contact
- anything that would stop {PERSONA_NAME}

====================================================
[OUTPUT — MUST FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE EXACTLY]

1) [SPOKEN SUMMARY AS {PERSONA_NAME} — 20–30 seconds]
Write a short “what I’d say out loud” summary in first-person:
- What I expected
- What I liked
- What worried me
- What would make me convert/contact today

2) [NEEDS PATH CHECK]
- Did the site make it easy to choose the right path for the persona’s needs? (Yes / No)
- Why (1 short sentence)
- Evidence (URL + where + quote)

3) [YES/NO/MAYBE VERDICT]
- Would {PERSONA_NAME} convert/contact? (Yes / No / Maybe)
- Why (3 short bullets)
- What stopped them (3 short bullets)

4) [SIMPLE SCORECARD 1–5]
Give a score and one plain-English reason for each:
- Clear what they do:
- Feels relevant to the persona:
- Proof (numbers/results):
- Trust (reviews/team/credibility):
- Easy to take the next step:
- Clear + transparent (what happens next / pricing or commitment / lock-in):

5) [TOP FIXES — “DO THIS NEXT” LIST] (max 6 items)
Each item MUST use this exact mini-template:

FIX #<n> (P0/P1/P2) — Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Problem (plain English):
- Evidence (URL + where + quote):
- Why it matters (1 short sentence):
- Do this (exact change + where on site):

(Guide: P0 = stops conversions, P1 = reduces trust, P2 = nice-to-have)

6) [QUICK ACTION PLAN]
- Do today (3 bullets max):
- Do this week (3 bullets max):

STYLE RULES
- Plain English only.
- No long paragraphs.
- Max 6 fixes total.
- Evidence is mandatory in every fix.
Begin now.
